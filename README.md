# Cat Pics E-Commerce

![](<./public/thmb (3).png>)

A React project to mix a little bit of everything I've learned so far! ðŸŽ‰
Although this is a Scrimba project, I mostly did it on my own: I coded and checked the videos _later_, so I could see what I could do differently or not, etc. In general though, I'm very proud that I've managed it all by myself.

It's very simple, but has lots of things I've been learning along the way. Here's a breakdown of what I used, and more screenshots can be found further down.

## Todo

**2023 update**

-   Update the images from this file;
-   use useReducer in various parts of this proect for better organization.

**React Tech**

-   Custom Hooks
-   useContext
-   React-Router-Dom
-   PropTypes

**CSS**

-   Modals
-   GRID & Flexbox

**Others**

-   [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/)
-   ESlint
-   Phosphor React (my absolute favorite icon library!

## Improvements and General Assessment

Most important, I'd add a mini back end. This is but a barebones e-commerce site, and it wouldn't be complete without it. That would allow better security and adding more things to the site.

Smaller things could be added, such as a better checkout page, and there's improvements in the CSS as well: better variables, and a better organization overall.

An option to make a new API call in the homepage, while maintaining the selected images would be useful too.

My main difficulty with the project was dealing with the useContext. It's not difficult in theory, but there are a lot of similar syntax and lots of little details that can break the SPA. But I believe that as I make more projects using it, all will be better hammered in my mind!
